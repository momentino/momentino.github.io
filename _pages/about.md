Hi! I am a Research Assistant at University of Trento, where I obtained my Master Degree in Artificial Intelligence Systems in July 2025.
I am currently supervised by Professor Raffaella Bernardi at UniBZ.  
I am interested mostly in evaluating and improving LLMs' agentic capabilities, and understanding how performing actions in controlled environments can affect their social and reasoning capabilities.  
I am also interested in the role language feedback in learning, and how we can develop effective feedback signals for increasing sample efficiency.
